This repository is about tracking my progress during the Samsung Innovation Campus program. It consists of 8 main chapters and 40 units in total.
The documents "UNIT 39" & "UNIT 40" consist of mini-projects that were mandatory during the course. 
This program allowed me to thrive into data analytics, so if you are interested too, you can check it out!
